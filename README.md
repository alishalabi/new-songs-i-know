<h2>Project: Songs I Know</h2>

<p>
If you are a musician, you know that the more songs you learn - the more songs you forget... which can be quite frustrating.
</p>

<p>
Songs-I-Know is a digital solution to this issue: a place for musicians to easily keep track of all the songs they learn over the years.
</p>

<p>
This will primarily be a back-end project. Making the "CRUD'ing" aspect easy for our musician users will be important, so we will be utilize the Django framework (known for its approachability and scaleability).
</p>

<p>
For each song title a user CRUD's, there will be an option to include Youtube (or other video) tutorials, tabs (sheet music), custom notes, and a relative scale of how much they have "mastered" that song (1-5).
